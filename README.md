# Multivariate Time Series Electricity Consumption Forecasting using ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and RNN-based Deep Learning Models

- Promoted energy conservation by developing time-series forecasting models to forecast daily-average electricity consumption patterns of a residential household.
- Incorporated weather variables and day category (weekday, weekend, vacation day, and COVID lockdown) in the prediction process.
- The optimal model is a RNN-based model (GRU) with MSE ~ 0.44.
